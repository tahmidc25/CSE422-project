# Artificial Intelligence Project – CSV Dataset Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project applies Artificial Intelligence techniques to analyze and make predictions based on data from a CSV file. It demonstrates the full workflow of:
- Data loading and cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature engineering
- Model training and evaluation
- Result visualization

The goal is to showcase how AI can be applied to structured datasets for insights and decision-making.

## 📂 Dataset
- **File format:** `.csv`
- **Source:** (Add your dataset source here — e.g., Kaggle, self-collected, UCI Machine Learning Repository)
- **Description:** The dataset contains relevant features for AI analysis. Each row represents an observation, and each column represents a variable.

## ⚙️ Technologies Used
- **Python** – Core programming language
- **pandas** – Data manipulation
- **numpy** – Numerical operations
- **matplotlib / seaborn** – Data visualization
- **scikit-learn** – Machine learning models
